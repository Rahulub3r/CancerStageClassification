# Cancer Stages Classification

**Description:** Transformed data and tested supervised learning models in Python to solve a multi-class classification problem of detecting different stages of cancer
**Software:** Python 3.7 <br>
**Presentation:** Jupyter Notebook <br>
**Goal:** Develop predictive model to predict 3 classes of **Cancer** <br>
**Result:** Testing Accuracy > 70%<br>

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to classify cell images into 3 classes as follows:
1. No cancer
2. Stage 1 cancer
3. Stage 3 cancer

#### NOTE: Although, this was a project done for a peer, I found working on medical imaging data very interesting. Also, the data for this is confidential. Please contact me if you want to know more about this project <rahulub3r@gmail.com>
